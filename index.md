# Welcome to Smart Cast Help and Support

*This is the Help and Support Page of the Smart Cast.* 

*Our Smart Cast is developed for improving the process of healing a broken bone, by controlling the healing process and by improving patient comfort.*


## Important Notice
Please seek for doctor's advice before using this device. 
Before using any functions on the application, rememeber to turn on the bluetooth connection.


### Bone Healing Information
The bone healing process involves three stages. The stages are important for which settings you should use on the SmartCast. 

Stage 1: Acute Inflammation 
* Occurs in the first 48-72 hours post-injury, and lasts a total of 1-3 weeks 
* Expect tingling and throbbing sensations at location of injury, specifically expect a feeling of tightness between your arm and cast. 
* Make sure you frequently move your fingers and toes to keep blood circulation through your arm or leg of injury 
* Cold compress packs are suggested to keep swelling at a controlled amount. Application of cold compress at the sight of injury will reduce pain  
* When using the SmartCast, only use of the pressure is used during this period of time. The cast will also be secured in place with solid plates, allowing for no mobility  


Stage 2: Soft Callus Formation 
* Swelling has decreased, and heat may now be applied. Heat will help increase blood flow and will create a warm sensation in your arm. This warm sensation is normal
* New generate bone begins to harden from weeks 4-8
* At this stage, the heating on the SmartCast is now safe and beneficial to use. The pressure system may also still be used. Some of the plates will be removed from the cast allowing from limited mobility. 

Stage 3: Hard Callus and Remodeling Stage
* This stage can take several years for the new bone to be fully hardened to the same hardness of other bones in the body. 
* Remodeling of the new bone cell matrix occurs to make sure the bone is forming in the proper form and of proper density. 
* Heating is still recommended at the sight of injury to solidify the new bone and to create more bone growth
* At this stage, it is possible that a doctor might remove the cast completely. Please consult with your doctor before removing the cast. 


# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Will the cast hurt me?**
No.
There is a safety shut off just in case of emergency. 

**2. Can I shower with it?**
No, this cast is not water proof and you need a plastic protection over it when taking a shower.

**3. Are there any food or nutrients that can help me heal quicker?**
Yes
Avoid caffeine and smoking cigarettes, which can restrict blood flow
Eating lower cholesterol and fat diet can improve blood circulation 
Calcium is a good source of nutrition for bone regeneration 

**4. How long will I have to wear the cast for?**
The duration of time spent wearing the SmartCast is dependent on the type of fracture you have, and the severity of the fracture. With this being said, it can take anywhere from 4-6 weeks, and upwards of 3 months in which you may have to wear the cast. Please consult with your doctor for a more accurate answer to this question. 

**5. Why are pressure and heat being applied to my broken bone?**
The method of healing being implemented into the SmartCast is a method which will increase and improve the overall blood flow at the sight of injury. Blood is essential for the healing process as blood carries all nutrients necessary for bone regeneration. Angiogenesis is the process in which new blood vessels form at the sight of injury post-injury. By adding pressure and heat, we can increase the speed of angiogenesis, and control the expansion of blood vessels and the blood pressure at the sight of injury. The result allows for more blood at the sight of injury, which will speed up the bone regeneration process. 

**6. What do I do if I feel sudden severe pain?**
In case of an incident involving a sudden increase in pain at the injury sight, use the emergency shutoff button on your phone app, and immediately seek medical attention. 

**7. What do I do if my injured limb starts to turn red or purple color?**
Immediately call 911 and use the emergency turn off button on your phone app.
